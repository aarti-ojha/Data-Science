-- Using Common Table Expressions (CTE)
-- A CTE allows you to define a subquery block that can be referenced within the main query. 
-- It is particularly useful for recursive queries or queries that require referencing a higher level

-- First, CTEs start using a "With" Keyword. Now we get to name this CTE anything we want
-- Then we say as and within the parenthesis we build our subquery/table we want
WITH CTE_Example AS 
(
SELECT gender, SUM(salary), MIN(salary), MAX(salary), COUNT(salary), AVG(salary)
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
GROUP BY gender
)
-- directly after using it we can query the CTE
SELECT *
FROM CTE_Example;
